# NSX-Toolkit
This is my own private project which is targeted to develop Swiss Army Knife kind of small but useful tools to help 
VMware NSX-v operation and automation.

- Export_dfw_to_csv script can help you get Json format NSX-V DFW rules from NSX manager then put into a CSV file 
so that you can view and search your DFW rules more intuitive.
